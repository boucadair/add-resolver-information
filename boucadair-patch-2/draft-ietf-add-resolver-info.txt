Abstract

   This document specifies a method for DNS resolvers to publish
   information about themselves.  DNS clients can use the resolver
   information to identify the capabilities of DNS resolvers.  How DNS
   clients use such an information is beyond the scope of this document.

1.  Introduction

   Historically, DNS clients communicated with recursive resolvers
   without needing to know anything about the features supported by
   these resolvers.  However, recent developments (e.g., Extended Error
   Reporting [RFC8914] or encrypted DNS) imply that earlier assumption
   no longer generally applies.  Typically, DNS clients can discover and
   authenticate encrypted DNS resolvers provided by a local network
   (e.g., using the Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR)
   [RFC9463] and the Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR) [RFC9462]),
   however, these DNS clients can't retrieve information from the
   discovered recursive resolvers about their capabilities.  Instead of
   depending on opportunistic approaches, DNS clients need a more
   reliable mechanism to discover the features that are supported by
   resolvers.

   This document fills that void by specifying a method for stub
   resolvers to retrieve such information.  To that aim, a new resource
   record (RR) type is defined for DNS clients to query the recursive
   resolvers.  The information that a resolver might want to expose is
   defined in Section 5.  That information is selected because it
   provides benefits to the security and privacy of DNS data.  Other
   information can be registered in the future per the guidance in
   Section 8.2.

   Retrieved information can be used to feed the server selection
   procedure.  However, that selection procedure is out of the scope of
   this document.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].  The
   following additional terms are used:

   Encrypted DNS:  Refers to a DNS scheme where DNS exchanges are
      transported over an encrypted channel between a DNS client and
      server (e.g., DNS over HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484], DNS over TLS (DoT)
      [RFC7858], or DNS over QUIC (DoQ) [RFC9250]).

   Encrypted DNS resolver:  Refers to a DNS resolver that supports any
      encrypted DNS scheme.

   Reputation:  "The estimation in which an identifiable actor is held,
      especially by the community or the Internet public generally"
      (Section 1 of [RFC7070]).

3.  Retrieving Resolver Information

   A DNS client that wants to retrieve the resolver information may use
   the RR type "RESINFO" defined in this document.  The content of the
   RDATA in a response to a query for RESINFO RR QTYPE is defined in
   Section 5.  If the resolver understands the RESINFO RR type, the
   RRSet MUST have exactly one record.  Invalid records MUST be silently
   ignored by DNS clients.  RESINFO is a property of the resolver and is
   not subject to recursive resolution.

   A DNS client can retrieve the resolver information using the RESINFO
   RR type and the QNAME of the domain name that is used to authenticate
   the DNS resolver (referred to as the Authentication Domain Name (ADN)
   in DNR [RFC9463]).

   If the Special-Use Domain Name "resolver.arpa", defined in [RFC9462],
   is used to discover an encrypted DNS resolver, the client can
   retrieve the resolver information using the RESINFO RR type and QNAME
   of "resolver.arpa".  In this case, a client has to contend with the
   risk that a resolver does not support RESINFO.  The resolver might
   pass the query upstream, and then the client can receive a positive
   RESINFO response either from a legitimate DNS resolver or an
   attacker.  The DNS client MUST set the Recursion Desired (RD) bit of
   the query to 0.  The DNS client MUST discard the response if the AA
   flag in the response is set to 0, indicating that the encrypted DNS
   resolver is not authoritative for the response.

   If a group of resolvers is sharing the same ADN and/or anycast
   address, then these instances SHOULD expose a consistent RESINFO.

4.  Format of the Resolver Information

   The resolver information record uses the same format as DNS TXT
   records.  The format rules for TXT records are defined in the base
   DNS specification (Section 3.3.14 of [RFC1035]) and further
   elaborated in the DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) specification
   (Section 6.1 of [RFC6763]).  The recommendations to limit the TXT
   record size are discussed in Section 6.1 of [RFC6763].

   Similar to DNS-SD, the RESINFO RR type uses "key/value" pairs to
   convey the resolver information.  Each "key/value" pair is encoded
   using the format rules defined in Section 6.3 of [RFC6763].  Using
   standardized "key/value" syntax within the RESINFO RR type makes it
   easier for future keys to be defined.  If a DNS client sees unknown
   keys in a RESINFO RR type, it MUST silently ignore them.  The same
   rules for the keys as those defined in Section 6.4 of [RFC6763] MUST
   be followed for RESINFO.

   Resolver information keys MUST either be defined in the IANA registry
   (Section 8.2) or begin with the substring "temp-" for names defined
   for local use only.

5.  Resolver Information Keys/Values

   The following resolver information keys are defined:

   qnamemin:  The presence of this key indicates that the DNS resolver
      supports QNAME minimisation [RFC9156] to improve DNS privacy.
      Note that, per the rules for the keys defined in Section 6.4 of
      [RFC6763], if there is no '=' in a key, then it is a boolean
      attribute, simply identified as being present, with no value.

      This is an optional attribute.

   exterr:  If the DNS resolver supports extended DNS errors (EDE)
      option [RFC8914] to return additional information about the cause
      of DNS errors, the value of this key lists the possible extended
      DNS error codes that can be returned by this DNS resolver.  A
      value can be an individual EDE or a range of EDEs.  Range values
      MUST be identified by "-".  When multiple non-contiguous values
      are present, these values MUST be comma-separated.

      This is an optional attribute.

   infourl:  An URL that points to the generic unstructured resolver
      information (e.g., DoH APIs supported, possible HTTP status codes
      returned by the DoH server, or how to report a problem) for
      troubleshooting purposes.  The server that exposes such
      information is called "resolver information server".

      The resolver information server MUST support the content-type
      'text/html'.  The DNS client MUST reject invalid the URL if the
      scheme is not "https".  Invalid URLs MUST be ignored.  The URL
      SHOULD be treated only as diagnostic information for IT staff.  It
      is not intended for end user consumption as the URL can possibly
      provide misleading information.  A DNS client MAY choose to
      display the URL to the end user, if and only if the encrypted
      resolver has sufficient reputation, according to some local policy
      (e.g., user configuration, administrative configuration, or a
      built-in list of respectable resolvers).

      This is an optional attribute.

   New keys can be defined as per the procedure defined in Section 8.2.

6.  An Example

   Figure 1 shows an example of a published resolver information record.

     resolver.example.net. 7200 IN RESINFO qnamemin exterr=15-17
                           infourl=https://resolver.example.com/guide

            Figure 1: An Example of Resolver Information Record

   As mentioned in Section 3, a DNS client that discovers the ADN
   "resolver.example.net" of its resolver using DNR will issue a query
   for RESINFO RR QTYPE for that ADN and will learn that the resolver
   supports:

   *  QNAME minimisation,

   *  Blocked (15), Censored (16), and Filtered (17) EDEs, and

   *  that more information can be retrieved from
      https://resolver.example.com/guide.

7.  Security Considerations

   DNS clients communicating with discovered DNS resolvers MUST use one
   of the following measures to prevent DNS response forgery attacks:

   1.  Establish an authenticated secure connection to the DNS resolver.

   2.  Implement local DNSSEC validation (Section 10 of [RFC8499]) to
       verify the authenticity of the resolver information.

   It is important to note that, of these two measures, only the first
   one can apply to queries for 'resolver.arpa'.

   An encrypted resolver may return incorrect information in RESINFO.
   If the client cannot validate the attributes received from the
   resolver, that will be used for resolver selection or displayed to
   the end-user, the client should process those attributes only if the
   encrypted resolver has sufficient reputation according to local
   policy (e.g., user configuration, administrative configuration, or a
   built-in list of reputable resolvers).  This approach limits the
   ability of a malicious encrypted resolver to cause harm with false
   claims.

8.  IANA Considerations

      Note to the RFC Editor: Please update "RFCXXXX" occurrences with
      the RFC number to be assigned to this document.

8.1.  RESINFO RR Type

   This document requests IANA to update this entry from the "Resource
   Record (RR) TYPEs" registry of the "Domain Name System (DNS)
   Parameters" registry group available at [RRTYPE]:

   Type: RESINFO
   Value: 261
   Meaning: Resolver Information as Key/Value Pairs
   Reference: RFCXXXX

8.2.  DNS Resolver Information Key Registration

   This document requests IANA to create a new registry entitled "DNS
   Resolver Information Keys" under the "Domain Name System (DNS)
   Parameters" registry group ([IANA-DNS]).  This new registry contains
   definitions of the keys that can be used to provide the resolver
   information.

   The registration procedure is Specification Required (Section 4.6 of
   [RFC8126]).

   The structure of the registry is as follows:

   Name:  The key name.  The name MUST conform to the definition in
      Section 4 of this document.  The IANA registry MUST NOT register
      names that begin with "temp-", so these names can be used freely
      by any implementer.

   Description:  A description of the registered key.

   Specification:  The reference specification for the registered
      element.

   The initial content of this registry is provided in Table 1.

    +==========+=====================================+===============+
    |   Name   | Description                         | Specification |
    +==========+=====================================+===============+
    | qnamemin | The presence of the key name        |    RFCXXXX    |
    |          | indicates that QNAME minimization   |               |
    |          | is enabled                          |               |
    +----------+-------------------------------------+---------------+
    |  exterr  | Lists the set of supported extended |    RFCXXXX    |
    |          | DNS errors.  It must be an INFO-    |               |
    |          | CODE decimal value in the "Extended |               |
    |          | DNS Error Codes" registry.          |               |
    +----------+-------------------------------------+---------------+
    | infourl  | Provides an URL that points to an   |    RFCXXXX    |
    |          | unstructured resolver information   |               |
    |          | that is used for troubleshooting    |               |
    +----------+-------------------------------------+---------------+
